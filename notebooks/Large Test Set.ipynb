    "## Goal ##\n",
    "The goal of this test set is to show that what was found in the smaller data set is generalizable to a larger number of proteins with a wide range of sizes and available homologs, orthologs, and paralogs. This set of proteins was used previously (Marcos et al., 2011) to evaluate covariance predictions. By using this dataset it should be possible to show the generalizability of the method as well as make a better comparison to previous methods.\n",
