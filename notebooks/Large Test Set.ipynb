    "# Large Test Set #\n",
    "## Goal ##\n",
    "The goal of this test set is to show that what was found in the smaller data set is generalizable to a larger number of proteins with a wide range of sizes and available homologs, orthologs, and paralogs. This set of proteins was used previously (Marcos et al., 2011) to evaluate covariance predictions. By using this dataset it should be possible to show the generalizability of the method as well as make a better comparison to previous methods.\n",

    "In this case that means:\n",
    "* Downloading PDB files for the proteins in our small test set.\n",
    "* Extracting a query sequence from each PDB file.\n",
    "* Searching for paralogs, homologs, and orthologs in a custom BLAST database built by filtering the Uniref90 database.\n",
    "* Filtering the hits from the BLAST search to meet minimum and maximum length requirements, as well as minimum and maximum identity requirements.\n",
    "* Building alignments using CULSTALW in both the fasta and msf formats since some of the tools which will be used for comparison need different formats.\n",
