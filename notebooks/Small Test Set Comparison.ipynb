    "## Method Comparison\n",
    "We now begin comparing methods based on their ability to predict the structural contacts in the proteins in this test set. There is an important consideration in the case of sequence separation and different measures by which to compare the methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Cleaning\n",
    "These data need an additional cleaning step beyond what was performed for the timing comparison. Since there are multiple categories of sequence separation and some proteins may not have any True Positive contacts for a category the scoring for that protein is incomplete. We will remove all such proteins from the comparison, performing the clean up separate for each metric of success. Another contributing factor which necessitates this kind of cleaning is assessment of the top K predictions for a protein or best L/K predictions which for poor predictions may not include any predictions of True Positives.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sequence Separation\n",
    "One important consideration for the difficulty of prediction and interest in predictions is the distance between the residues for which coupling was predicted. As has been documented in the literature, especially in the CASP competitions, there are several categories of prediction:\n",
    "* Neighbors (1 - 5 residues apart) - This is the least interesting category of predictions. It is highly likely that residues this close together will show covariance signal. Predicting two residues are in contact that are this close together is trivial and uninformative.\n",
    "* Short (6 - 12 residues apart) - This is also not a very interesting type of prediction. Residues this close in proximity can be more easily modeled by alogrithms which focus on 2D protein structure modeling (identifying beta sheets, alpha helices, etc.).\n",
    "* Medium (13 - 24 residues apart) - This is a more interesting type of prediction. The resiudes in this range of separation are on the edge of the 2D protein structure prediction range.\n",
    "* Long (24 and more residues apart) - The most interesting category of predictions. Resiudes this far apart are not easily modeled by 2D protein structure modeling systems. They are also very useful for 3D and 4D protein structure prediction becausae they provide constraints on potential protein (similar to NMR data) folds which makes protein folding a more tractable problem for modelers.\n",
    "* Any/All - All categories can be considered at once, this provides a summary value, but is often skewed by one particularly good category of predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Metrics of Success\n",
    "* AUROC - This measures the True Positive Rate vs the False Positive Rate of prediction, it can be considered a measure of the accuracy of the measure. This can be strongly influenced by the class imbalance which is present when predicting structural contacts since there are many fewer contacts than non-contacts. The True Positive case is if the C-beta of two amino acids is within 8.0 Angstroms of one another (as is done in the CASP competitions)."
